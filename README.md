# Binary-Search-Tree-Project
This project will focus on storing data in an ordered manner that makes it easy to search for items and add items to the structure


As a good rule of thumb the project will be built using good principles of coding one of which is 
compartmentalization.
This is the very reason we have a header file for formal declarations for our funtions and defintion of variables we want to use.
